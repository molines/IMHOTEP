# Definition of IMHOTEP configuration

## Context
A series of runs are foreseen during the IMHOTEP project.   
A first set of runs, based on a global eORCA025 configuration, is dedicated on the sensitivity
of the ocean  circulation to different runoff scenarii. The focus is put on 3 regions : (i) the 
tropical Atlantic, (ii) Greenland and (iii) the northern part of the indian ocean.  Runs in the 
first set are single member runs.   

In the second set of runs, 10 members, ensemble runs will be performed. For this purpose, a global 
eORCA05 configuration will be set up, and used as a mother grid for 2 AGRIF nests at 1/4 deg 
resolution, nests being located on the regions on focus. This latter ensemble configuration is very 
innovative for mixing multiple AGRIF nests in an ensemble run. Further more, one nest is located 
over the E-W periodic  boundary of the global configuration. 

## Road map:
 In order to achieve the goals of the project we plan to follow the following technical roadmap, 
regarding NEMO configurations:
 * Set up the eORCA025 mono member configuration
 * Perform first set of simulations
 * Set up an eORCA05 configuration
 * Add the Atlantic and Indian AGRIF nests
 * Add ensemble capabilities
 * Perform the second set of simulations.
