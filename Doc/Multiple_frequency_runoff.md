# NEMO implementation for multiple runoff, calving ... files
## 1. Context:
It is very often that input data for runoff or calving have frequency depending on the localisation: for instance, in IMOTHEP we use IsBA interannual daily runoff almost
everywhere, except around Greenland where data are only monthly. On the other hand, in some part of the proect, we will switch off interannual runoff locally and use climatology
instead.  Therefore there is a need for using multiple files for runoff or calving or even ISF, having different frequency or different type (climatology vs interannual).
