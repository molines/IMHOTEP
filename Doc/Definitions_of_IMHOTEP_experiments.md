# Definition of IMHOTEP configurations

## 1. Context
A series of runs are foreseen during the IMHOTEP project.   
A first set of runs, based on a global eORCA025 configuration, is dedicated to the sensitivity
of the ocean  circulation to different runoff scenarii. The focus is put on 3 regions : (i) the 
tropical Atlantic, (ii) Greenland and (iii) the northern part of the Indian Ocean.  Runs in the 
first set are single member runs.   

In the second set of runs, 10 members, ensemble runs will be performed. For this purpose, a global 
eORCA05 configuration will be set up, and used as a mother grid for 2 AGRIF nests at 1/4 deg 
resolution, nests being located on the regions on focus. This latter ensemble configuration is very 
innovative for mixing multiple AGRIF nests in an ensemble run. Furthermore, one nest is located 
over the E-W periodic  boundary of the global configuration. 

## 2.  General road map:
In order to achieve the goals of the project we plan to follow the following technical roadmap, 
regarding NEMO configurations:
 * Set up the eORCA025 mono member configuration
 * Perform first set of simulations
 * Set up an eORCA05 configuration
 * Add the Atlantic and Indian AGRIF nests
 * Add ensemble capabilities
 * Perform the second set of simulations.

## 3. eORCA025 configuration
### 3.1 Physical domain:
Decision was taken to use eORCA025 domain instead of ORCA025 (eORCA025 takes into account antarctic ice-shelves realistically):
  * This configuration is used in OMIP.
  * Freshwater discharge from Antarctica is much better representend and iceberg calving can be treated in a realistic way.
  * When using a great number of cores for computation, the overcost is reasonable as there are many land-only domains, which are skipped during the computation.
The improvement is mainly in the Ross Sea and Weddel Sea.
### 3.2 NEMO code:
We decided to use NEMO version 4.0.6
  * This is the last stable version of the NEMO 4.0.x series. It has already widely been tested and risks are limited with this version, which make
it suitable for this project.
### 3.3 Configuration files:
In NEMO 4.0.x, almost all configuration dependent adjusments have been eliminated. Those adjustments now appear in configuration files that are
prepared, in the pre-processing phase of a run.  There are many files used in a realistic configuration !  For the project, a particular effort 
has been made in the preparation of these files, aiming at the documentation of all the technical steps performed, in order to improve tracability.
In [this document](../eORCA025/Preparing_eORCA025.md), the full procedure is reported. Please refer to it for details.   In the following, we just
summarize the actions and decision taken.

#### 3.3.1 Domain_cfg :
This file describe the numerical grid, horizontally and vertically. We took horizontal parameters from P. Mathiot eORCA025.L121 configuration.
(see Pierre's  [documentation](https://pmathiot.github.io/NEMOCFG/docs/build/html/simu_eORCA025.html#monitoring) for all details). For the vertical grid
we choose the standard DRAKKAR's 75-levels.
  * Bathymetry :  eORCA025_bathymetry_b0.2_closed_seas_greenland.nc.  This file is basically Pierre's bathymetry, in which the closed seas are removed, and  the
bathymetry around Greenland is adjusted using BedMachineGreenland-2020-04-10.nc file (see details [here](../eORCA025/BUILD/GREENLAND-BATHY/README.md)).
  * Coordinates :  eORCA025_coord_c3.0.nc
#### 3.3.2 Initial conditions and SSS restoring:
World Ocean Atlas 2018 monthly climatology corresponding to the period 1981-2010 was choosen to compute the initial conditions. It gives in-situ 3D temperature and relative salinity.  For NEMO, potential temperature (theta-0) was computed from original temperature and salinity.
#### 3.3.3 Forcing files (except runoff)
JRA55 forcing data set was prefered to DFS5.2 (which is discontinued in 2017).
  * This data set has the great advantage to cover the period 1958-present (updated each year).
  * It is also widely used in OMIP experiments.
#### 3.3.4 Other Auxiliary files:
Other auxiliary files are  needed for running the configuration, they are just mentioned here for record:
  * BFR2D file : Defines the location where enhanced bottom friction is used.
  * SHLAT2D file : Locally defines the kind of lateral boundary condition (free-slip, no-slip, strong-slip)
  * RESTO : indicates the 3D restoring time scale for T and S  and where 3D restoring is used.
  * DISTCOAST : a file indicating the distance to the coast used to fade out SSS restoring near the coast.
  * IWM : Internal wave mixing input files, used in the Delavergne parameterization. Gives maps of 5 variables (mixing power, and decay scales).
  * WEIGHT : Using Interpolation On the Fly (IOF) in NEMO for atmospheric forcing and geothermal fluxes, weight files used for the interpolation 
(either bilinear or bicubic) must be provided.
#### 3.3.5 Runoff files (specific to this project).
Three sources for building the runoff files were used:
  * **ISBA** : daily runoff from 1979-2018. Only liquid runoff. For the climatological run, we computed the daily climatology and eliminate the runoff 
corresponding to Greenland and Antarctica, which are treated separately. 
Data were provided by Fabrice Papa, William Llowel and projected on the NEMO grid using Julien Jouanno python tool.
  * **GrIS** : monthly Greenland freshwater discharge provided by Jeremie Mouginot, Pierre Mathiot et Nicolas Jourdain. A monthly climatology for the period 
1950-1972 has been computed. The data are given on the *ad-hoc* NEMO points, in the vicinity of 262 locations around Greenland where estimates of liquid 
and solid freshwater discharges  are computed from a mass-balance model.  The main problem is that most of the glaciers  that feed the freshwater discharge 
had their termination upstream narrow fjords, not representend within the eORCA025 grid.  Another specific problem is also that there are bathymetric 
sills that prevent deep fjords waters to connect to the open ocean. A consequence of these problems, is that part of the icebergs calving from the 
glacier termination melt into the fjords before reaching the NEMO point. An estimate of 50% of melting of the icebergs in the fjords was taken.  
Therefore GrIS data provide:
    * Solid freshwater flux (calving rate) : 50% of the quantity issued at the glacier front. This calving rate will be used for explicit representation of the icebergs in NEMO (ICB). 
    * Liquid freshwater flux corresponding to the melting of icebergs (50% of the quantity issued at the glacier front). This freshwater flux will be used in NEMO within the iceshelf representation (ISF),
associated with a particular depth range. Latent heat flux will be taken into account.
    * Liquid fresh water flux coming from inland surface waters : this flux will be used in NEMO as a river runoff (RNF).
  * **RIGNOT et al. (2013)** : For Antarctica, climatological annual data were already prepared by Pierre Mathiot, using Rignot et al estimates. They will be 
introduded in NEMO as :
    * Calving rate for NEMO-ICB module (located at the iceshelve edge).
    * Basal iceshelf melting for NEMO-ISF module, using Pierre Mathiot parameterization, introducing the basal melting as freshwater flux applied on a depth range, at the iceshelf edge.

  * Runoff depths for NEMO paramerizations are provided in two files (one for RNF and one for ISF), obtained by merging all the data sources (fixed in time!).

Modifications in NEMO were necessary in order to deal with multiple dataset (different frequency, different type --climatological or interanual--). This was done for runoff, calving and iceshelf data set.
    

### 3.4 namelists
  * Ocean : [namelist.eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP00](../eORCA025/eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP00/CTL/namelist.eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP00)
  * Ice : [namelist_ice.eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP00](../eORCA025/eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP00/CTL/namelist_ice.eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP00)

### 3.5 XML files where model output are fixed:
In our setting, NEMO model output are managed by the XIOS server, running asynchronously with NEMO. This provides a very flexible choice for the variables we want to output as well as for the
output frequency. Furthermore, subdomains or sections can be output by theirself.  All the choices are passed to XIOS via the file `iodef.xml` that must be edited to fit our needs.

*TO BE DISCUSSED*

### 3.6 Scalability experiment.
A scalability experiment was perfomed on jean-zay, from 240 cores (6 nodes) to 2400 cores (60 nodes). For this experiment, we choose to use 4 xios servers, running on a separated
computing node. Three-days runs (216 time steps of 1200 sec) were used, and  the last day was taken for evaluating the performance (measured as step/mn). On figure 1 we present the scalability diagram.

<img src=./Figures/scalability.png  width=130% />

On this busy picture, X-axis  corresponds to the number of cores used for NEMO.  Blue points, corresponds to the actual performance (step/mn, left Y-axis), and red points 
are the equivalent, assuming a perfect scalability (with reference to the 280 cores case). Brown points show the efficiency (%, left Y-axis), which is the ratio between actual and theoretical performances.  Except for some outliers, the efficiency is very close to (or above) 100%, until 1800 cores, but still very good up to 2400 cores, (85%). According to these
performances, yellow points indicates the elapsed time for 1yr of simulation (hours, right Y-axis), and green points the CPU hours for 1 year (hoursx10, left Y-axis). Due to the 
good scalability, the CPU hours are very stable (except for the outliers), around 2500 hours/years. In general, the performance decreases somehow when the model spins-up and when
the number of icebergs is stabilized. So, regarding this experiment, we can estimate  that 1year of eORCA025 experiment should not cost more than 3250 hours (taking a margin of 30%).

The sweet spot for this experiment is probably around 1500 cores, considering the trade off between queue waiting-time and elapsed time. 

## 4. eORCA05 configuration

This configuration is not standard. A specific program was written to create eORCA05.L75 grid, using eORCA025 horizontal grid. Once the grid is created, 
all configuration files where also created, using the same data sources than for eORCA025.
This action was started very early in the project in order to anticipate potential problems. In particular, AGRIF nests that are foreseen in the second 
stage of the project, cross the periodic line in the Indian Ocean. An old workaround (proposed by Gurvan in the early stage of DRAKKAR ~2006), never 
tested so far, has been implemented: Shifting the eORCA05 grid by 180 degrees, so that the E-W periodic line stands in the Eastern Pacific, away from AGRIF nests. 
A dedicated program to perform the shift on all configuration files was specifically written, and ... **IT WORKS !**  The shifted eORCA05 configuration 
was named eCAOR05.L75 (it is important to change the name, in order to avoidconfusions).
