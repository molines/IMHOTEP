# IMHOTEP.GAI
## Description
This experiment uses the exact same code than IMHOTEP.S. The same correction term is added to the precip and no SSS restoring is used.

## Continental Fresh Water Fluxes:
In this experiment, all continental fresh water fluxes have an interannual variability (Except for Antarctica where we only have climatological forcing).
