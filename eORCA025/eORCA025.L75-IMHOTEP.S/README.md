# IMHOTEP.S : Climatological reference
## History
This run is identical to IMHOTEP02, except for the SSS restoring: Instead of having a restoring term, we add a correction term to the precip, computed
from the SSS restoring term build in IMHOTEP02 (the spin-up run). We use an interannual, monthly average for this term.

This is the only difference with IMHOTEP02 run. As for all sensitivity experiment, the period of simulation is 1980-2018.

## Continental Fresh Water Fluxes :
  * ALL fluxes are climatological.
