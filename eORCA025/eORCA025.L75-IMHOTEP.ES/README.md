# eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP.ES

## Overview
This experiment is the ensemblist version of run  eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP.S (deterministic). It is performed with the same global domain as eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP.S, with 10 members.

## Code
The code is the ensemblist version of NEMO@version 4.0.6, as it was used for  the deterministic simulation.  Details on how the code was ensemblized (mainly by Jean-Michel Brankart -- IGE ) are given in the [porting document](../../Doc/Ensemblization.md)

## Simulation paradigm
### creating initial spread
