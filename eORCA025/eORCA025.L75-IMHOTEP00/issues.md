# Running eORCA025.L75-IMHOTEP00
We prepare all the input files as reported in the [**BUILD**](../BUILD) directory. We set up the namelist according to the name of the input files.

## 0. Very first try
  * model blows up at first time step. A look at output.abort.nc shows weird zone where dynamical fields and tracer fields has NaN. The area with NaN
forms large triangle with oblique sides at 45 degree.
  * After checking my log book (!), I have already found this problem due to the use of key_vect_opt_loop
  * unsetting this CPP keys, fix this problem.

## 1. Starting the model
  * model blows up after 12 step.
  * decreasing the time step do not help much
  * changing initial condition change the place of the blow-up
  * eliminating runoff, rnf_isf, calving, geothermal does not change basically.

## 2. Debug.
### 2.1 Baseline gives: (rn_rdt = 1200 seconds)

```
E R R O R
kt 13 |ssh| max   2.004     at i j   1263  875    MPI rank 125
kt 13 |U|   max   13.96     at i j k 1264  884  1 MPI rank 125
kt 13 Sal   min   4.005     at i j k 1197 1042 14 MPI rank 141
kt 13 Sal   max   40.81     at i j k 1360  787 11 MPI rank 105
  ```

  * The model blows at I=1264, J=884 at the surface, sur to high velocities (proc rank 125) (in the Black Sea)
  * A look at output.abort_0125.nc shows indeed high velocities, but almost regular temperature and salinity fields.
  * Weird vertical velocities (but difficult to interpret after so few time steps.

### 2.2 Isolating the  Black sea to make test quicker:
  * need to create a new configuration and retails all input files....
  * dcm_mkconfdir_local BSIMH025.L75-JM01
  * retail with ncks command:

  ```
  ncks -d x,1255,1318 -d y,862,922

  ```

  * script `mkBSIMH.sh`
  *  ==> Good point : reproduce the same error 
  *  ==> Bad point  : dont know why
  * many tests switching on/off diffusion, advection, runoff etc ...
  * ==> kind of magic : error disappear when switching off the restoring (tradmp)

### 2.3 back to eORCA025.L75-IMHOTHEP00
  * Able to start the model.... 
  * Explosion at step 1120 very robust. Disappear when tradmp not used....
  * ==> change restoring dataset from gouretski to WOA18 : OK !
Gouretski, month 2 has probably a problem with spurious bad values ....

### 2.4 adding icebergs on the fly
  * with standard code, not possible to start iceberg  in a restart segment: looking for iceberg restart file.
  *  ==> key_drakkar : add  ln_rstart_icb in namberg_drk and replace ln_rstart by ln_rstart_icb in icb_ini.F90

### 2.5 adding iwm (internal wave mixing (Casimir Delavergne ) : `ln_zdfiwm = .true.` in namzdf

### 2.6 adding BFR2D : `ln_boost = .true.` in namdrg_bot

### 2.7 adding BBC   : `ln_trabbc = .true.`in nambbc

### 2.8 adding BBL   : `ln_trabbl = .true.`in nambbl
