# Gouretski 2018 climatology
## Context
Gouretski TS climatology differs from other by the fact that is was produced in an isopycnal framework, and transformed to z level at the end of the gridding process.
By the way, both data set are available : on isopycnal and on iso level. In Drakkar we were keen in using this climatology for deep TS restoring in the southern ocean,
with the idea of avoiding the introduction of spurious buoyancy,  the data set being stable, by construction. The drawback was that only annual data were available 
(which is not a major problem when restoring is done in the deep ocean).  A new version of this data set was released in 2018, with monthly fields. We decided to
evaluate this recent data set in order to use it in the project.
