# Lateral boundary condition enhancement : shlat2D
## 1. Context
Lateral boundary conditions are dealing with the `no-slip`  vs `free-slip` condition. This represents the assumption whether the tangential coastal velocity vanish at the coast (no-slip) or is unaffected (free-slip).  This is a way to define the lateral boundary layer, which obviously depends on the model resolution. 
In NEMO, we can define  lateral boundary condition from strong-slip to free-slip (passing through no-slip). 

In fact, on the C-grid, there are no 'tangential' velocity point on the coast line. If we take the example of a N-S coast, there are U velocity points on 
the coastal mask (set to 0, normal velocity). The V points are located half a grid cell off the coast.  The lateral boundary condition is implemented in the way the
vorticity component  dV/dx is computed at the coastal F-point: In case of free-slip, dv/dx=0 meaning no variation of V when getting near the coast. In case of no-slip,
V@F-points should be 0 (which can be represented if the mirror V-point in land (symetric to F-point) has -V value, giving a 0 value at the middle F-point. 
Thus, in this case, the vorticity component is (V - (-V))/dx = 2 V/dx.

NEMO implementation introduces a namelist coefficient `shlat` which  is used in the computation of the vorticity component : dv/dx=  shlat * V /dx (V being the first 
in sea, tangential velocity point). Hence, shlat=0 corresponds to free-slip and shlat= 2 corresponds to no-slip. But the concept of strong slip (shlat > 2) can be
imagined: it just increases the vorticity at the 
coast (in order to mimic a thinner lateral boundary layer).

In the DRAKKAR version of NEMO, we decided to use a 2D field for the shlat coefficient, because we want to use localized no-slip or strong-slip lateral boundary conditions.  The 2D coefficient
is stored in the file whose building is decribed here.


## 2. Realisation
The shlat2d  file is built using cdfmkresto CDFTOOL. [mkshlat2d.sh](./mkshlat2d.sh) bash script was written as a wrapper of cdfmkresto. This is also a good way to ensure tracability.

The main lines  are : free-slip everywhere except 
  * Bering Strait : we implement no-slip in order to reduce the inflow in the Arctic
  * Whole Mediterranean sea : we set no-slip for all the area, following advices of Med Sea experts (UIB). The rational for this is not clear to my mind, although it has a great impact on 
the Alboran gyres. 
  * Along West Greenland coast: Setting a stripe of no-slip condition, helps the destabilization of Western Greenland Current (WGC), and the shedding of eddies at Cape Desolation, which is
observed (for instance on EKE derived from satelite altimetry).
