# Making of the Greenland runoff and calving files
## 1. Context
Greenland runoff (liquid and solid) were infered from a mass balance model of the Greenland icesheet (see for example Mouginot et Al, 2019) and provided to 
the project by Jeremie Mouginot, Pierre Mathiot and Nicolas Jourdain. 

Main sources of liquid and solid runoff are the glaciers and ice sheets. Some glacier have  a terrestrial end, with all the melted waters forming 
a river that arrives to the Sea. Other glacier have a marine end, with a floating ice tongue.  These latter glaciers contribute to both solid 
(calving of iceberg at the glacier front) and liquid (with surface waters and melted water being released  at the bottom of the glacier tongue, at a depth 
depending on the glacier thickness). One of the main problem for forcing an ocean model is that, in case of relatively coarse resolution (coarse compared the the fjords
width) the first sea-point off the model coastline is far from the actual position of the glacier front or the river mouth. More over, a bathymetric sill is very often 
observed downstream fjords. In addition, part of the calved icebergs melt in the fjord before reaching the first model sea point !  Considering all these details, some 
choices have to be made to provide NEMO with liquid discharge, deptht of the discharge, and calving rate.  There is a big uncertainty on the amount of freshwater released by 
icebergs that are melting in the fjords.  The litterature on this point (very few indeed), gives for some fjords, melted estimates ranging from 30% to 80%  of the calved icebergs.Pragmatically, a conservative choice of 50% have been made so far, so that half of the calved iceberg mass is converted to liquid discharge (associated to the glacier depth),
and the remnant half is used as a calving source at NEMO first sea-point.


## 2. Programs
### 2.1 Checking
  * **GrIS_chk.f90** : This is a basic reader of the GrIS file. It also build the actual model bathymetry from the mesh-mask file, using `gdepw_0` and `mbathy` variables. Then it performs 2 kinds of check:
    * Localisation of the runoff point in GrIS file (comparing `lon_nemo`, `lat_nemo` with `glamt`, `gphit`).
    * Comparing the actual depth of the model runoff points, and the `rnfdep` variable in the GrIS file. This comparison showed large discrepancies with the initial bathymetry, and pushed us to rebuild a new bathymetry around Greenland, based on recent BedMachine bathymetry. Details of this procedure can be found in this [document](../GREENLAND-BATHY/README.md).
  * **GrIS_chk_bat.f90** : This program only perform the bathymetry comparison, taking the depths from a new test bathymetric file. It allows the correction of some remnant problems in an
iterative way.  Once no more problems are reported the bathymetry is OK and can be merged with the global one.
  * **GrIS_chk_double.f90** : In the GrIS file provides by Jeremie Mouginot et Al., a single NEMO point can receive different runoff/calving contribution. This program detect and list the NEMO points receiving more than one contribution. Decision is to be taken on how the case of multiple source on a single point is treated for the simulation.
