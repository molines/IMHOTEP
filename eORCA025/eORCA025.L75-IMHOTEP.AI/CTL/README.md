# CONFIGURATION eORCA025.L75-AI
  * This configuration shares the same code than GAI GI and GA configurations.
  * In this configuration, all fresh water forcing ( rnf, isfrnf and calving ) are interannual except all fresh water fluxes from Greenland
  * Remember that for antarctica, we always maintain a climatological forcing ( the only one available to the project). 

# Preparation of FWF files
  * Antarctica : isfrnf and calving: unchanged
  * RNF ISBA interannual : unchanged
  * Greenland : isfrnf, rnf and calving : changed to climatological ( the ones uses in IMHOTEP.S ( IMHOTEP02).
